Show your primary results numerically with its errors.

Explicitly show the goals of the experiment. Which theory do you want to prove? or which physical constant to measure?
Be specific about the goals. Mention the theory you want to prove.

briefly introduce the experimental methods


Use the IPL calculator to find the error of the slope.
compare the experimental-theoretical result difference with the experimental error.
