Show your primary results numerically with their errors.

the abstract should be a brief summary of your paper. Try three sentences: what did you do, what are your primary results, and what is your conclusion

Explicitly show the goals of the experiment. Which theory do you want to prove? or which physical constant to measure?
Be specific about the goals. Mention the theory you want to prove or the constant you want to measure.

Introduce the background quantitatively.

briefly introduce the experimental methods

past the table, not a screenshot

Use the labels to explain your figures. Make the readers understand it by just reading the label.
Use the labels to explain your tables, what does each column stand for?
Try this 5-column style: | explanation | symbol | value | error | unit |

Theoretical values have no errors
always show errors along with the data
one digit of sig fig for error, and align the number of decimal places of the value with it
Specify what caused the error, systematic or random, and how much it could affect the result.

Use the IPL calculator to find the error of the slope.
compare the experimental-theoretical result difference with the experimental error.
Be more quantitative, compare the experimental-theoretical result difference with the experimental error.

suggest some improvements to overcome the most significant source of error
